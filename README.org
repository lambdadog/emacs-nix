#+TITLE: emacs-nix
A patched version of Emacs that enables providing your ~init~ and
~early-init~ via Nix.
* Usage
It's recommended to use the [[https://app.cachix.org/cache/emacs-nix#pull][~emacs-nix~ Cachix cache]] when using
~emacs-nix~, as my CI pushes to it on every commit.

Using ~emacs-nix~ involves a bit of scaffolding, for which I haven't
yet created a GitHub template. As such, the easiest way to start for
now is to simply clone my own [[https://github.com/lambdadog/emacs-config][~emacs-config~ repository]] and modify it
to your liking.
